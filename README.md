# fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz Algorithm implementation based in TDD.

Rules:

- I have to receive in a method an integer:
- If the input integer is multiple of 3, I will return "Fizz".
- If the input integer is multiple of 5, I will return "Buzz".
- If the input integer is multiple of 3 and 5, I will return "FizzBuzz".
- For the rest of integer, I will return the own integer.
- I have to process the first 100 integers.
